## IBM Cloud Backup
{: #ibm-cloud-backup}

{{site.data.keyword.backup_full}} is an automated agent-based backup system that is managed through the {{site.data.keyword.backup_notm}} WebCC browser-based management utility, providing users with a method to back up data between servers in one or more data centers on the {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer}} network.  Administrators can set backups to follow an hourly, daily, weekly, or custom schedule that targets full systems, specific directories, or even individual files.  Additional plug-ins allow for compatibility with software like Microsoft Exchange and Microsoft SQL, as well as other types of third-party software and enables users to perform a Bare Metal Restore, when necessary.

For more information about {{site.data.keyword.backup_notm}} services, see [Getting Started with {{site.data.keyword.backup_notm}} services](/docs/Backup?topic=Backup-getting-started).

## R1Soft CDP
{: #r1soft-cdp}

Continuous Data Protection (CDP) is a high-performance backup software created by R1Soft that allows for backup of both physical and virtual devices. Idera CDP consists of three main components: the CDP server, the agent, and the database plugins, which are available for purchase separately from the first two components.  Because R1Soft CDP is a third-party backup solution, interactions with CDP take place entirely outside of {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_short}} proprietary interfaces; however, R1Soft CDP passwords can be tracked and stored within {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console.  All other interactions with R1Soft CDP are documented on the R1Soft website.
