# Viewing portable storage  
{: #view-portable-storage}

 Portable storage is a secondary storage disk that can be detached from one virtual server and attached to another.
 A portable storage disk can be connected to one virtual server at a time and retains all information
 that is stored on it for easy transfer between devices. Portable storage can be purchased and applied
 to your virtual server at any time.

## Before you begin
{: #before-you-begin-viewing-portable-storage}

First, navigate to the device menu and ensure you have the correct account permissions to complete the tasks.

* Navigate to your console's device menu. For more information, see [Navigating to devices](/docs/virtual-servers?topic=virtual-servers-navigating-devices).
* Ensure you have any necessary account permissions and device access. Only the account owner, or a user with the **Manage Users** classic infrastructure permission, can adjust the permissions.

For more information about permissions, see [Classic infrastructure permissions](/docs/account?topic=account-infrapermission) and [Managing device access](/docs/virtual-servers?topic=virtual-servers-managing-device-access).
