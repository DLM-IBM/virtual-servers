# Managing port speeds
{: #managing-port-speeds}

You can modify the speed that your server is negotiating at without opening a support ticket.

## Before you begin
{: #before-you-begin-managing-port-speeds}

First, navigate to the device menu and ensure you have the correct account permissions to complete the task. 

* Navigate to your console's device menu. For more information, see [Navigating to devices](/docs/virtual-servers?topic=virtual-servers-navigating-devices).
* Ensure you have any necessary account permissions and device access. Only the account owner, or a user with the **Manage Users** classic infrastructure permission, can adjust the permissions. 

For more information about permissions, see [Classic infrastructure permissions](/docs/iam?topic=iam-infrapermission#infrapermission) and [Managing device access](/docs/virtual-servers?topic=virtual-servers-managing-device-access).

## Managing port speeds
{: #manage-port-speeds}

Complete the following steps to update port speeds.

1. From the **Devices** menu, select **Device List**.
3. Select the server that you want to update.
4. In the **Overview** tab, go to **Network details.**
5. Select the drop-down menu in **Speed** (for either public or private network) to update port speed.

A manual configuration change for your server's network settings is required to complete the port speed change.
